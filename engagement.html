          I joined the Iloilo-Cebu Educational Tour and the BSTM Soirée, which deepened my passion for tourism. In my second year, I competed in Pahampang and won the Dancing FA competition, where I choreographed our routine. I also represented the College of Arts and Sciences in the dancesport competition during Pahampang. Additionally, I represented the ISAT U main in the intercampus dancesport contest, where I became a qualifier for the RSCUAA. These experiences strengthened my confidence and fueled my dream.

          I joined Pahampang in my freshman year, which sparked my interest in school events. In my second year, I joined Dancing FA and won both competitions I participated in. I also joined a Dayaw competition in celebration of the campaign violence against women. As the writer of our piece, I witnessed firsthand how powerful and moving it is to perform a Dayaw piece. It was a meaningful experience, and I look forward to participating again.
